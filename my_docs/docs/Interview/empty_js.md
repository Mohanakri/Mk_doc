Good question üëç Let‚Äôs walk step by step about what happens in the **background when JavaScript executes an empty file (or even before running any code).**

---

### 1. **JavaScript Execution Context Creation**

Whenever JavaScript starts execution, it first creates a **Global Execution Context (GEC)**.
Even if your file is empty, this step still happens.

* **Memory phase (a.k.a. Creation phase / Hoisting phase):**
  JS sets up a global object and environment to store variables and functions.

  * In browser ‚Üí the global object is **`window`**
  * In Node.js ‚Üí the global object is **`global`**

* A special object called **`this`** is created and points to the global object.

* A **memory space (heap + stack)** is created for variables/functions (currently empty if file has no code).

---

### 2. **Call Stack Initialization**

The **call stack** (Execution Stack) is created.

* The very first thing pushed is the **Global Execution Context**.
* If you don‚Äôt have any functions in your code, nothing else gets pushed.
* Once execution finishes, the Global Execution Context eventually gets popped off (but in reality, it stays alive until your script ends).

---

### 3. **Hoisting (Pre-scan)**

Even in an empty file:

* JS engine scans for variables/functions to allocate memory.
* Since it‚Äôs empty, no variables/functions get hoisted.

---

### 4. **Code Execution Phase**

* Since there‚Äôs no actual code, the execution phase does nothing.

---

### 5. **Background (Runtime Environment) Setup**

Even for an empty file, the JS engine sets up:

* **Memory Heap** ‚Üí for objects (empty right now)
* **Call Stack** ‚Üí with one GEC
* **Event Loop** & **Callback Queue** ‚Üí ready to handle events, timers, promises, etc.

That‚Äôs why if you later write code like `setTimeout(...)` or `fetch(...)`, it will work ‚Äî the background infrastructure is already prepared.

---

‚úÖ **So, in short:**
When JS runs an empty file, behind the scenes the engine still:

1. Creates the Global Execution Context
2. Allocates memory space (nothing inside yet)
3. Initializes the call stack with GEC
4. Prepares runtime environment (heap, event loop, callback queue)

---

Do you want me to **draw a diagram** showing how memory + call stack + event loop look when running an empty JS file?
---------------------------------------------
Great, you‚Äôre digging into the **engine-level details** now üëå Let‚Äôs break it piece by piece.

---

## 1. **Hoisting = Pre-scan**

Yes ‚úÖ ‚Äî During the **creation phase** of the Global Execution Context (GEC), JavaScript **scans the whole code first**:

* All variables declared with `var` are **hoisted** (allocated in memory, initialized with `undefined`).
* All functions declared with `function` are **hoisted** (stored in memory with the full function body).
* `let` and `const` are also hoisted but placed in a **temporal dead zone (TDZ)** ‚Äî they are not accessible until execution reaches their line.

üëâ This happens **inside the Global Execution Context (GEC)**.

---

## 2. **Why `window` and `this` are the same in browsers?**

In browsers:

* The **global object** is called `window`.
* In the global scope, the keyword **`this` points to the global object**.

So:

```js
console.log(window === this); // true
```

This is because the JS engine makes `this` equal to the global object in the **global execution context**.

---

## 3. **When are `window` and `this` different?**

* **Inside functions in non‚Äìstrict mode**:

  ```js
  function test() {
    console.log(this); // window
  }
  test();
  ```

* **Inside functions in strict mode**:

  ```js
  'use strict';
  function test() {
    console.log(this); // undefined
  }
  test();
  ```

* **Inside an object method**:

  ```js
  const obj = {
    name: "Aditya",
    show: function() {
      console.log(this.name); // "Aditya"
    }
  };
  obj.show();
  ```

* **In Node.js**:
  The global object is `global`, not `window`, and in the global scope `this` is **not equal** to `global` ‚Äî instead it‚Äôs `{}` (an empty object).

---

## 4. **What is Memory Heap?**

Think of JS memory in two main parts:

* **Call Stack** ‚Üí keeps track of execution order (functions).
* **Heap** ‚Üí unstructured memory storage for objects, arrays, functions.

üì¶ Example:

```js
let x = 10;              // stored in Call Stack
let obj = { a: 1 };      // reference stored in Call Stack
                         // actual {a:1} stored in Heap
```

---

## 5. **Does Memory Heap contain `window` and `this`?**

Yes ‚úÖ

* The **`window` object** is a **huge object** (with `alert`, `document`, `console`, etc.) ‚Äî stored in the **Heap**.
* A reference to it is assigned to **`this`** in the Global Execution Context.
* In the Call Stack ‚Üí the GEC holds a reference to the global object (`window`).

So:

* **Heap**: actual `window` object (all browser APIs).
* **Stack**: Execution Context that holds a pointer to it via `this`.

---

### üîë Summary:

* Hoisting = pre-scan to allocate memory inside Global Execution Context.
* In browsers ‚Üí `window` = global object; `this` in global scope points to it.
* They differ in strict mode, inside functions, or in Node.js.
* Heap stores big objects like `window`; Call Stack stores execution contexts (which reference those heap objects).

---

Would you like me to **draw a diagram** showing how the stack + heap + global object (`window`) + `this` are connected during global execution?
