??? question "Q1: Create EFS and Mount on Single EC2"

```
1. Create an EFS file system in the AWS console, select the desired VPC and subnets.
2. Create a security group for EFS allowing NFS (port 2049) from EC2â€™s security group.
3. Launch an EC2 instance in the same VPC/subnet.
4. Install NFS utilities on EC2: `sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils`.
5. Mount EFS: `sudo mount -t efs <EFS_ID>:/ /mnt/efs`.
6. Verify by creating a test file in `/mnt/efs`.
```

??? question "Q2: Mount EFS on Multiple EC2 Instances"

```
1. Create an EFS file system with mount targets in all AZs where EC2 instances exist.
2. Create EC2 instances in different AZs with NFS client installed.
3. Allow NFS inbound rules between EC2 and EFS security groups.
4. Mount EFS on all EC2 instances using the same directory path.
5. Create a file from one EC2 and verify it appears on the others.
```

??? question "Q3: Access EFS Across Availability Zones"

```
1. Ensure EFS has mount targets in each AZ of the VPC.
2. Launch EC2 instances in different AZs.
3. Install EFS utilities on each EC2.
4. Mount the same EFS on all EC2s.
5. Test read/write access to verify cross-AZ availability.
```

??? question "Q4: EFS Backup to S3 Using DataSync"

```
1. Create an AWS DataSync task with EFS as the source and S3 as the destination.
2. Ensure DataSync IAM role has EFS and S3 permissions.
3. Create an agent if required (for cross-account/region).
4. Schedule or run the task to copy files from EFS to S3.
5. Verify S3 bucket contains EFS data.
```

??? question "Q5: EFS Access with IAM Authorization"

```
1. Enable IAM authorization when creating EFS.
2. Create an IAM policy granting `elasticfilesystem:ClientMount` and `elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite`.
3. Attach the IAM policy to EC2â€™s instance profile.
4. Mount EFS with IAM authorization enabled:  
   `sudo mount -t efs -o iam <EFS_ID>:/ /mnt/efs`.
5. Verify only IAM-permitted EC2 instances can access EFS.
```

??? question "Q6: EFS with ECS Tasks for Shared Storage"

```
1. Create an EFS file system with access points.
2. In ECS task definition, add a volume specifying EFS file system ID.
3. Map the EFS volume to the container path.
4. Deploy ECS service with multiple tasks.
5. Verify containers share files via EFS.
```

??? question "Q7: EFS with AWS Lambda for File Processing"

```
1. Create an EFS file system and access point.
2. Create a Lambda function in the same VPC.
3. Configure Lambda to mount the EFS access point.
4. Write Lambda code to read/write files to EFS.
5. Trigger Lambda (e.g., via API Gateway) to process and store files in EFS.
```

??? question "Q8: Multi-Region EFS Data Replication Simulation"

```
1. Set up EFS in Region A and S3 bucket in the same region.
2. Use AWS DataSync to sync EFS â†’ S3 in Region A.
3. Create another EFS in Region B.
4. Use DataSync to sync S3 (Region A) â†’ EFS (Region B).
5. Verify replication by checking files in Region B EFS.
```

??? question "Q9: Performance Tuning for EFS in High-Load Applications"

```
1. Enable Provisioned Throughput if consistent high performance is needed.
2. Use `Max I/O` performance mode for large-scale workloads.
3. Distribute files across directories to improve performance.
4. Mount with recommended NFS options for low latency.
5. Monitor performance via CloudWatch metrics.
```
