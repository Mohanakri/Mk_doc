## üå± Beginner Projects

??? question "Q1: Create and Attach an EBS Volume to an EC2 Instance"

```
1. Launch an EC2 instance in the AWS Console.
2. Create a new EBS volume in the same Availability Zone as the instance.
3. Attach the volume to the instance via the AWS Console or CLI.
4. Connect to the EC2 instance via SSH.
5. Format the volume using `mkfs.ext4`.
6. Mount it to a directory (e.g., `/mnt/data`).
7. Verify mounting using `df -h`.
```

??? question "Q2: Resize an Existing EBS Volume"

```
1. Go to the AWS Console ‚Üí EC2 ‚Üí Volumes.
2. Select your EBS volume and modify its size (e.g., from 8GB to 20GB).
3. Wait for the modification state to complete.
4. SSH into the EC2 instance.
5. Use `lsblk` to verify new size.
6. Run `sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1` and `sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1` to expand the filesystem.
```

??? question "Q3: Create a Snapshot of an EBS Volume"

```
1. Identify the EBS volume from EC2 ‚Üí Volumes.
2. Select ‚ÄúCreate Snapshot‚Äù.
3. Give it a name and description.
4. View progress in EC2 ‚Üí Snapshots.
5. Optionally, restore a new volume from the snapshot.
```

## üöÄ Intermediate Projects

??? question "Q4: Automate EBS Snapshot Creation with AWS CLI"

```
1. Install and configure AWS CLI (`aws configure`).
2. Use `aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-xxxx --description "Daily backup"` command.
3. Schedule the command in crontab for daily backups.
4. Verify snapshots in AWS Console.
```

??? question "Q5: Create Encrypted EBS Volumes"

```
1. While creating an EBS volume, check the ‚ÄúEnable Encryption‚Äù option.
2. Select a KMS key (AWS-managed or custom).
3. Attach and mount as normal.
4. Verify encryption status in the AWS Console under ‚ÄúEncryption‚Äù column.
```

??? question "Q6: Attach Multiple EBS Volumes to One EC2 Instance"

```
1. Create two or more EBS volumes in the same AZ as the EC2 instance.
2. Attach each volume via the console.
3. SSH into EC2 and run `lsblk` to confirm multiple volumes.
4. Mount each to separate directories or create a RAID configuration using `mdadm`.
```

## üèÜ Advanced Projects

??? question "Q7: Implement EBS Multi-Attach for High Availability"

```
1. Use io1 or io2 EBS volume type (supports multi-attach).
2. Create volume with ‚ÄúMulti-Attach enabled‚Äù.
3. Attach to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ.
4. Use a clustered filesystem like GFS2 or OCFS2 to manage concurrent writes.
```

??? question "Q8: Create an EBS-Backed Auto Scaling Group with Data Persistence"

```
1. Create a launch template with an EBS root volume and additional EBS data volume.
2. Enable snapshot restoration in the launch template.
3. Configure Auto Scaling group using the template.
4. Ensure lifecycle hooks to save and restore data from snapshots.
```

??? question "Q9: Automate EBS Volume Lifecycle with Lambda and CloudWatch"

```
1. Create a CloudWatch Event Rule to trigger daily.
2. Lambda function (Python/Boto3) lists EBS volumes, creates snapshots, and deletes old ones.
3. Test Lambda function manually.
4. Deploy and monitor logs in CloudWatch.
```

If you want, I can make the **CloudFront, Direct Connect, and EBS** project lists all in **this same Markdown-with-answers-in-code-blocks style** so they‚Äôre consistent. Would you like me to do that next?
