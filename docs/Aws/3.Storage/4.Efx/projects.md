## üê£ Beginner Level

??? question "Q1: Create and Mount an EFS to One EC2 Instance"

```
1. Create an EFS file system in AWS Console.
2. Create a mount target in the same VPC and AZ as your EC2.
3. SSH into EC2 and install EFS mount helper: `sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils`.
4. Mount EFS: `sudo mount -t efs <file-system-id>:/ /mnt/efs`.
5. Verify with `df -h` and store files in `/mnt/efs`.
```

??? question "Q2: Mount EFS to Multiple EC2 Instances"

```
1. Create EFS with mount targets in each AZ where your EC2s run.
2. SSH into each EC2 instance.
3. Install EFS mount helper on all EC2s.
4. Mount EFS to `/mnt/efs` on each EC2.
5. Test shared storage by creating a file from one EC2 and reading it from another.
```

??? question "Q3: Create EFS with Lifecycle Management"

```
1. Create EFS and enable Lifecycle Policy to move files to IA (Infrequent Access) after X days.
2. Mount EFS to an EC2 instance.
3. Upload files and wait for lifecycle policy to transition them to IA.
4. Check storage class using `ls -l` and EFS console metrics.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Intermediate Level

??? question "Q4: Use EFS Across Multiple Availability Zones"

```
1. Create an EFS file system.
2. Create mount targets in each AZ of your VPC.
3. Launch EC2 instances in different AZs.
4. Install EFS mount helper and mount the same EFS on all instances.
5. Test cross-AZ file sharing by creating and reading files.
```

??? question "Q5: Configure EFS Backup with AWS Backup"

```
1. Create an AWS Backup plan.
2. Add your EFS file system as a resource.
3. Schedule daily/weekly backups.
4. Store backups in a Backup Vault with encryption enabled.
5. Restore from backup to verify recovery process.
```

??? question "Q6: Set Up EFS Access Points for Different Applications"

```
1. Create an EFS file system.
2. Create separate Access Points for different apps, each with its own root directory and permissions.
3. Mount EFS using Access Point ID in EC2.
4. Ensure each app writes only to its own directory.
5. Test access restrictions between applications.
```

## üöÄ Advanced Level

??? question "Q7: Integrate EFS with EKS for Stateful Workloads"

```
1. Create EFS and mount targets in your VPC.
2. Deploy AWS EFS CSI Driver in your EKS cluster using Helm.
3. Create a StorageClass and PersistentVolumeClaim using EFS.
4. Deploy a StatefulSet or Deployment that uses the PVC.
5. Verify pods can share and persist data even after restarts.
```

??? question "Q8: Automate EFS Deployment with Terraform and Mount on EC2"

```
1. Write Terraform code to:
   - Create EFS file system
   - Create mount targets
   - Output EFS ID
2. Provision EC2 instance in same VPC and AZ.
3. Use user_data script to install EFS utils and mount automatically.
4. Apply Terraform and verify EFS mount on EC2.
```

??? question "Q9: Secure EFS with IAM Authorization and Encrypted Data in Transit"

```
1. Enable encryption at rest while creating EFS.
2. Create an EFS access policy allowing specific IAM roles to mount.
3. Use TLS for in-transit encryption with `-o tls` mount option.
4. Test mounting with authorized IAM role and reject unauthorized attempts.
5. Monitor access logs for security auditing.
```

If you want, I can now prepare **AWS FSx** beginner ‚Üí advanced projects in this same style. That way, you‚Äôll have the **complete shared storage project set** (EBS, EFS, FSx).
