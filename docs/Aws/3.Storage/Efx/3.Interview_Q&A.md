I'll search for the latest AWS EFS interview questions to provide you with comprehensive content focused on concepts and steps rather than code.Let me fetch specific EFS interview questions from the dedicated source:Based on my research, here are comprehensive AWS EFS interview questions organized by difficulty and topic areas:

## **Basic EFS Concepts (1-15)**

**1. What is Amazon EFS?**
- A fully managed, scalable, and elastic cloud-based file storage service designed for modern applications
- Built on AWS infrastructure and seamlessly integrates with other Amazon services
- Automatically scales up or down based on usage patterns

**2. How does EFS differ from EBS?**
- EFS: Shared file storage across multiple instances, uses NFS protocol, automatically scales
- EBS: Block-level storage for single instance, requires manual scaling, better for databases

**3. Which protocols does EFS support?**
- NFSv4 and NFSv4.1 protocols
- Enables compatibility with existing applications without modifications

**4. What are the key features of EFS?**
- Elasticity (automatic scaling)
- Durability & Availability (multiple AZ replication)
- Performance optimization options
- Security integration with IAM, VPC
- Cost optimization with lifecycle policies

## **Performance and Configuration (16-30)**

**5. What are the EFS performance modes?**
- **General Purpose**: Low-latency operations, suitable for web servers, content management
- **Max I/O**: High-throughput for data-intensive workloads like big data analytics

**6. How to choose between performance modes?**
- Consider latency sensitivity, metadata operation frequency, and required throughput
- General Purpose for frequent metadata access
- Max I/O for high parallel access to large datasets

**7. What is EFS Bursting Throughput?**
- Allows file systems to temporarily exceed baseline throughput using burst credits
- Credits earned based on file system size
- Can burst up to 100 MiB/s per TiB of storage

**8. How to optimize EFS performance in multi-AZ deployment?**
Steps to optimize:
1. Use EFS One Zone storage classes for cost reduction
2. Implement EFS Lifecycle policies for automatic transitions
3. Use Provisioned Throughput for consistent high performance
4. Mount using recommended AWS mount options
5. Distribute client instances across multiple AZs
6. Monitor CloudWatch metrics and optimize accordingly

## **Security and Access Control (31-45)**

**9. How does EFS access control work?**
- Combination of IAM policies and NFS permissions
- IAM policies define AWS resource access
- NFS permissions control file/directory level access
- Both must be evaluated for user access

**10. How to implement EFS encryption?**
Steps for encryption setup:
1. Enable encryption at rest during file system creation
2. Use AWS KMS for key management
3. Install amazon-efs-utils package for TLS support
4. Configure clients with TLS mount option
5. Modify /etc/fstab with tls option
6. Mount using secure communication

**11. What are EFS security best practices?**
Steps to secure EFS:
1. Use IAM policies for access control
2. Enable encryption at rest and in transit
3. Configure VPC security groups properly
4. Use Network ACLs for additional security
5. Monitor with CloudTrail and CloudWatch
6. Regularly review and audit permissions

## **Cost Optimization (46-55)**

**12. What are EFS storage classes?**
- **Standard**: For frequently accessed data
- **Infrequent Access (IA)**: ~85% cheaper for less frequently accessed data
- **EFS One Zone**: Single AZ storage for cost optimization

**13. How do EFS Lifecycle policies work?**
Steps to configure:
1. Create EFS file system
2. Navigate to Lifecycle management tab
3. Add policy with transition period
4. Choose Standard to IA transition timing
5. Optionally set deletion period
6. Save policy for automatic cost optimization

**14. What factors affect EFS billing?**
- Storage usage (GB-months)
- Throughput (Bursting vs Provisioned)
- Data transfer charges
- Lifecycle management transitions
- Backup and restore operations

## **Integration and Advanced Features (56-70)**

**15. How to integrate EFS with AWS Lambda?**
Considerations and limitations:
1. Cold start latency increases
2. Concurrent execution may cause throttling
3. No mandatory file lock support
4. Throughput scaling depends on storage size
5. Additional costs compared to ephemeral storage
6. Regional availability limitations

**16. How to migrate data to EFS?**
Migration steps:
1. Choose method (AWS DataSync for online, Snowball for offline)
2. Set up source storage system access
3. Create EFS file system with proper configuration
4. Configure DataSync agent and tasks
5. Execute migration process
6. Validate migrated data integrity
7. Update application configurations

**17. How to use EFS in hybrid cloud scenarios?**
Setup steps:
1. Establish connection via Direct Connect or VPN
2. Configure routing and security settings
3. Create EFS file system with mount targets
4. Configure security groups for on-premises access
5. Install NFS client on on-premises servers
6. Mount EFS using DNS name of mount targets

## **Monitoring and Troubleshooting (71-85)**

**18. How to monitor EFS performance?**
Key metrics to track:
1. PermittedThroughput
2. BurstCreditBalance
3. ClientConnections
4. DataReadIOBytes/DataWriteIOBytes
5. MetadataIOBytes
6. TotalIOBytes

**19. How to troubleshoot EFS performance issues?**
Troubleshooting steps:
1. Check performance mode configuration
2. Monitor CloudWatch metrics for bottlenecks
3. Optimize NFS client settings (rsize/wsize)
4. Use parallelization techniques
5. Evaluate network connectivity
6. Review file access patterns and identify hotspots

**20. How to backup and restore EFS?**
Backup steps:
1. Create backup plan in AWS Backup
2. Define frequency and retention period
3. Assign EFS resources to backup
4. Monitor backup progress

Restore steps:
