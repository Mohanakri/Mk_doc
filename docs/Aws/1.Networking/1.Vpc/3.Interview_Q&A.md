# AWS VPC Interview Questions and Answers

## Basic Level Questions

### 1. What is Amazon VPC?
**Answer:**
Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. It provides complete control over your virtual networking environment, including:
- Selection of IP address ranges
- Creation of subnets
- Configuration of route tables and network gateways
- Security settings

### 2. What are the main components of a VPC?
**Answer:**
The main components include:
- **VPC**: The virtual network itself
- **Subnets**: Segments of the VPC's IP address range
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)**: Connects VPC to the internet
- **NAT Gateway/Instance**: Allows private subnet instances to access internet
- **Route Tables**: Define traffic routing rules
- **Security Groups**: Instance-level firewalls
- **Network ACLs**: Subnet-level firewalls
- **VPC Endpoints**: Private connections to AWS services

### 3. What is the difference between a public and private subnet?
**Answer:**
- **Public Subnet**: Has a route to an Internet Gateway in its route table, instances can have public IP addresses and directly communicate with the internet
- **Private Subnet**: No route to Internet Gateway, instances only have private IP addresses and cannot directly access the internet (need NAT for outbound internet access)

### 4. What are the default VPC limits?
**Answer:**
- 5 VPCs per region (can be increased)
- 200 subnets per VPC
- 200 route tables per VPC
- 50 route entries per route table
- 500 security groups per VPC
- 50 rules per security group

### 5. What IP ranges can you use for VPC CIDR blocks?
**Answer:**
Recommended private IP ranges (RFC 1918):
- `10.0.0.0/8` (10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255)
- `172.16.0.0/12` (172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255)
- `192.168.0.0/16` (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255)

CIDR block size must be between /16 and /28.

## Intermediate Level Questions

### 6. Explain the difference between Security Groups and NACLs.
**Answer:**

| Feature | Security Groups | Network ACLs |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Level** | Instance level | Subnet level |
| **Type** | Stateful | Stateless |
| **Rules** | Allow rules only | Allow and deny rules |
| **Rule Processing** | All rules evaluated | Rules processed in order |
| **Default Behavior** | Deny all inbound, allow all outbound | Allow all traffic (default NACL) |
| **Association** | Must be explicitly associated | Automatically applied to all instances in subnet |

### 7. What are the reserved IP addresses in a subnet?
**Answer:**
In every subnet, the first 4 IPs and last 1 IP are reserved:
- **First IP** (e.g., 10.0.0.0): Network address
- **Second IP** (e.g., 10.0.0.1): Reserved for VPC router
- **Third IP** (e.g., 10.0.0.2): Reserved for DNS server
- **Fourth IP** (e.g., 10.0.0.3): Reserved for future use
- **Last IP** (e.g., 10.0.0.255): Broadcast address

### 8. What is the difference between NAT Gateway and NAT Instance?
**Answer:**

| Feature | NAT Gateway | NAT Instance |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Management** | AWS managed | Self-managed |
| **Availability** | Highly available within AZ | Single point of failure |
| **Bandwidth** | Up to 45 Gbps | Depends on instance type |
| **Security Groups** | Cannot associate | Can associate |
| **Bastion Host** | Not supported | Can be used as bastion |
| **Cost** | Higher cost | Lower cost |
| **Maintenance** | No maintenance required | OS patches, updates required |

### 9. How does VPC Peering work and what are its limitations?
**Answer:**
**VPC Peering** creates a network connection between two VPCs using private IP addresses.

**Limitations:**
- No transitive peering (A-B-C: A cannot reach C through B)
- CIDR blocks cannot overlap
- One peering connection per VPC pair
- Cross-region peering has additional restrictions
- Cannot reference security groups across regions
- 50 VPC peers per VPC (125 with request)

### 10. What are VPC Endpoints and their types?
**Answer:**
VPC Endpoints enable private connectivity to AWS services without internet access.

**Types:**
1. **Gateway Endpoints**: 
   - For S3 and DynamoDB only
   - Added as route table targets
   - No additional charges

2. **Interface Endpoints**:
   - For most AWS services
   - Uses AWS PrivateLink
   - Creates ENI with private IP
   - Charged per hour and data processed
