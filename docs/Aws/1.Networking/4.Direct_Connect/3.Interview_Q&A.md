# AWS Direct Connect Interview Questions

## Basic Level Questions

### Q1: What is AWS Direct Connect and what are its main benefits?
**Answer:** AWS Direct Connect is a network service that provides a dedicated network connection from your on-premises environment to AWS, bypassing the internet. Main benefits include:
- Reduced network costs for large data transfers
- Increased bandwidth and predictable performance
- Lower latency compared to internet connections
- More consistent network experience
- Enhanced security through private connection

### Q2: What are the different types of Virtual Interfaces (VIFs) in Direct Connect?
**Answer:** There are two types of VIFs:
- **Private VIF**: Connects to your VPC using private IP addresses, allows access to EC2 instances and other VPC resources
- **Public VIF**: Connects to AWS public services (S3, DynamoDB, etc.) using public IP addresses

### Q3: What speeds are available for Direct Connect?
**Answer:** 
- **Dedicated connections**: 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and 100 Gbps (limited regions)
- **Hosted connections** (through APN Partners): 50 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 200 Mbps, 300 Mbps, 400 Mbps, and 500 Mbps

### Q4: Can you extend your on-premises VLANs into AWS using Direct Connect?
**Answer:** No, you cannot extend Layer 2 VLANs into AWS. Direct Connect operates at Layer 3 only and requires routing between networks.

### Q5: How is Direct Connect billed?
**Answer:** Direct Connect is charged based on:
- **Port hours**: Hourly rate for the dedicated port
- **Data transfer**: Outbound data transfer charges (inbound is typically free)

## Intermediate Level Questions

### Q6: How do you achieve high availability with Direct Connect?
**Answer:** High availability can be achieved through:
- **Multiple connections**: Set up 2 or more Direct Connect connections (active/active or active/standby)
- **Different locations**: Use connections from different Direct Connect locations
- **Link Aggregation Groups (LAG)**: Aggregate up to 4 connections for higher bandwidth and redundancy
- **VPN backup**: Maintain VPN connection as backup with higher BGP priority
- **Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)**: Enable for faster failure detection

### Q7: What is a Direct Connect Gateway and when would you use it?
**Answer:** Direct Connect Gateway is a globally available resource that allows you to connect your Direct Connect connection to multiple VPCs across different AWS regions. Use cases include:
- Connecting to VPCs in multiple regions from a single Direct Connect location
- Reducing the number of BGP sessions required
- Centralizing Direct Connect connectivity
- Sharing a single Direct Connect connection across multiple VPCs

### Q8: Explain the BGP requirements for Direct Connect.
**Answer:** BGP requirements include:
- **ASN**: You need a public ASN (must own it) or private ASN (64512-65535 range)
- **VLAN tag**: Unique, unused VLAN tag for each VIF
- **IP addressing**: /30 subnet for BGP peering
- **For Private VIF**: VPC Virtual Private Gateway ID
- **For Public VIF**: Public IP addresses allocated by customer

### Q9: How does routing work with Direct Connect?
**Answer:** 
- **Route propagation**: Can be enabled to automatically propagate customer routes to VPC
- **BGP**: Used for dynamic routing between customer and AWS
- **Route priority**: VPN can be used as backup with higher BGP priority
- **Route tables**: Must be updated to point traffic to Direct Connect connection
- **Limitation**: Only one 0.0.0.0/0 entry per route table

### Q10: What are the security considerations for Direct Connect?
**Answer:** 
- **No native encryption**: Direct Connect doesn't provide encryption by default
- **VPN over Direct Connect**: Can establish IPSec VPN tunnel over Direct Connect for encryption
- **Private connection**: Traffic doesn't traverse the public internet
- **Access control**: Use security groups and NACLs for additional security
- **BGP authentication**: Use BGP authentication keys

## Advanced Level Questions

### Q11: You have a requirement to encrypt data over Direct Connect. How would you implement this?
**Answer:** Since Direct Connect doesn't provide native encryption:
1. **VPN over Direct Connect**: Establish IPSec VPN connection over Direct Connect
   - Use Public VIF (not Private VIF)
   - Configure Customer Gateway and VPN connection
   - Benefits: Consistent throughput + encryption
2. **Application-level encryption**: Encrypt data at application layer
3. **Consider**: VPN over Direct Connect provides both consistent performance and security

### Q12: How would you troubleshoot a Direct Connect connection that's showing intermittent connectivity issues?
**Answer:** Troubleshooting steps:
1. **Check BGP session status**: Verify BGP is established and stable
2. **Monitor CloudWatch metrics**: Check ConnectionState, BGP session state
3. **Enable BFD**: For faster failure detection
4. **Verify routing**: Check route propagation and route tables
5. **Physical layer**: Check cable connections, port status
6. **VLAN configuration**: Verify VLAN tags are correct and unique
7. **IP configuration**: Confirm /30 addressing is correct
8. **BGP authentication**: Verify BGP keys match
9. **Review logs**: Check router logs and AWS Direct Connect logs

### Q13: Compare Direct Connect with VPN. When would you choose one over the other?
**Answer:** 

**Direct Connect advantages:**
- Higher bandwidth (up to 100 Gbps)
- Lower latency and more consistent performance
- Cost-effective for large data transfers
- Dedicated connection

**VPN advantages:**
- Quick setup (minutes vs weeks)
- Lower initial cost
- Built-in encryption
- Good for smaller workloads

**Choose Direct Connect when:**
- High bandwidth requirements
- Consistent performance needed
- Large data transfer volumes
- Predictable network costs important

**Choose VPN when:**
- Quick deployment needed
- Lower bandwidth requirements
- Encryption is mandatory
- Cost-sensitive for smaller workloads

### Q14: Explain how you would design a multi-region Direct Connect architecture.
**Answer:** 
1. **Use Direct Connect Gateway**: Central hub for multi-region connectivity
2. **Regional VGWs**: Create Virtual Private Gateways in each target region
3. **Associate VGWs**: Connect all regional VGWs to the Direct Connect Gateway
4. **Allowed prefixes**: Configure appropriate CIDR ranges for each region
5. **Routing**: Ensure proper routing between regions
6. **Redundancy**: Consider multiple Direct Connect locations for HA
7. **Consider Transit Gateway**: For more complex inter-VPC connectivity within regions

### Q15: What are Link Aggregation Groups (LAG) and how do they work?
**Answer:** 
- **Definition**: LAG allows aggregating multiple Direct Connect connections into a single logical connection
- **Benefits**: Higher bandwidth, automatic failover, load balancing
- **Limitations**: Up to 4 connections per LAG, all connections must be same speed and terminate at same location
- **Configuration**: All connections in LAG must have same bandwidth and terminate at same Direct Connect endpoint
- **Failover**: If one connection fails, traffic automatically redistributes across remaining connections
