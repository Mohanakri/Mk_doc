??? question "Q2: High Availability with Redundant Direct Connect Links"
    **Goal:** Build a fault-tolerant Direct Connect setup.  
    **Steps:**  
    1. Request two physical Direct Connect connections in different locations.  
    2. Configure BGP on both links with failover settings.  
    3. Test failover by disabling one connection.  

    **Teaches:** Redundancy, failover routing.  

---

??? question "Q3: Direct Connect + VPN Backup (Hybrid Failover)"
    **Goal:** Use VPN as a backup for Direct Connect link.  
    **Steps:**  
    1. Create a Direct Connect link with a Private VIF.  
    2. Create a Site-to-Site VPN connection to the same VPC.  
    3. Configure routing so Direct Connect is primary, VPN is secondary.  
    4. Test failover.  

    **Teaches:** Hybrid redundancy, route priority.  

---

??? question "Q4: Public + Private VIF on Same Connection"
    **Goal:** Use one Direct Connect link to access AWS public services and private VPC resources.  
    **Steps:**  
    1. Create a Direct Connect connection.  
    2. Configure a Public VIF for AWS services.  
    3. Configure a Private VIF for VPC access.  
    4. Test both paths separately.  

    **Teaches:** Multi-VIF setup, shared physical link.

This version will work directly in **MkDocs Material** and produce collapsible Q\&A-style sections.
If you want, I can also make a **Beginner ‚ÄúSimulated Lab‚Äù MkDocs page** so you can test all beginner DX projects without an actual Direct Connect link. That would make your docs fully runnable in a training environment.

Do you want me to prepare that simulation-friendly version next?
