## Introduction to Cloud Technologies

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is a computing model that provides on-demand access to shared computing resources over the internet. The term was first used in 1996 in a Compaq business plan.

**Historical Context:**
- Similar to 1950s mainframe computing accessed via terminals
- Modern cloud delivers services over internet to various devices
- Linux dominates cloud infrastructure (~90% of public clouds)

> **Note:** According to TOP500 association, all world's top 500 supercomputers run on Linux.
