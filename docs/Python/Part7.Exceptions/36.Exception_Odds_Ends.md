## Exception Handler Nesting

### Understanding Exception Propagation

Python uses a **LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack** for try statements. When an exception is raised, Python returns to the most recently entered try statement with a matching except clause.

!!! info "Key Concept"
    Exception propagation proceeds backward through time to try statements that have been entered but not yet exited.

### Runtime vs Syntactic Nesting

#### Runtime Nesting
When functions call other functions within try blocks:

```python
def action3():
    print(1 + [])              # Generate TypeError

def action2():
    try:                       # Most recent matching try
        action3()
    except TypeError:          
        print('Inner try')     # Match kills the exception
        raise                  # Unless manually reraised

def action1():
    try:
        action2()
    except TypeError:
        print('Outer try')     # Run only if action2 reraises
```

**Output:**
```
Inner try
Outer try
```

#### Syntactic Nesting
When try statements are physically nested in code:

```python
try:
    try:
        action3()
    except TypeError:        # Most-recent matching try
        print('Inner try')
        raise
except TypeError:            # Here, only if nested handler reraises
    print('Outer try')
```

### Exception Groups and Nesting

Exception groups follow similar nesting rules:

```python
def action3():
    raise ExceptionGroup('Nest*', [IndexError(1), TypeError(2), SyntaxError(3)])

def action2():
    try:
        action3()
    except* IndexError:        # Consume matches, rest propagate
        print('Got IE')

def action1():
    try:
        action2()
    except* TypeError:         # Consume matches, rest propagate
        print('Got TE')
```

**Output:**
```
Got IE
Got TE
# SyntaxError propagates to top-level handler
```

### Finally Clause Behavior

Unlike except clauses, **finally clauses don't kill exceptions** - they run during propagation:

```python
try:
    try:
        action3()
    finally:
        print('Inner try')
finally:
    print('Outer try')
```

**Output:**
```
Inner try
Outer try
# TypeError still propagates
```

## Exception Idioms and Patterns

### 1. Breaking Out of Nested Loops

Exceptions can serve as structured "goto" statements:

```python
class Exitloop(Exception): pass

try:
    while True:
        while True:
            for i in range(10):
                 if i > 3: raise Exitloop          # Break multiple levels
                 print('loop3: %s' % i)            
            print('loop2')
        print('loop1')
except Exitloop:
    print('continuing')                            

print(f'{i=}')                                     # Loop variable preserved
```

!!! tip "When to Use"
    Use this pattern when you need to exit multiple nested loops simultaneously. Regular `break` only exits the innermost loop.

### 2. Exceptions as Signals, Not Errors

#### EOF Handling Pattern
```python
while True:
    try:
        line = input()           # Read line from stdin
    except EOFError:
        break                    # Exit loop at end-of-file
    else:
        # Process next line here
        pass
```

#### Function Signaling Pattern
```python
class Found(Exception): pass

def searcher():
    if success_condition:
        raise Found()            # Signal success with exception
    else:
        return

try:
    searcher()
except Found:                    # Exception if item was found
    # Handle success
    pass
else:                            # else returned: not found
    # Handle failure
    pass
```

### 3. Resource Cleanup Patterns

#### try/finally Pattern
```python
myfile = open('somefile', 'w')
try:
    # Process myfile
    pass
finally:
    myfile.close()
```

#### Context Manager Pattern (Preferred)
```python
with open('somefile', 'w') as myfile:
    # Process myfile
    pass
```

### 4. Debugging with Outer try Statements

```python
try:
    # Run program
    pass
except:                         # All uncaught exceptions come here
    import sys
    print('uncaught!', sys.exc_info()[0], sys.exc_info()[1])
```

### 5. In-Process Testing Pattern

```python
import sys
log = open('testlog', 'a')

def testdriver():
    while moreTests():
        try:
            runNextTest()
        except:
            print('FAILED', testName(), sys.exc_info()[:2], file=log)
        else:
            print('PASSED', testName(), file=log)
```

## Exception Information Access

### sys.exc_info()

Returns a tuple `(type, value, traceback)` for the currently handled exception:

```python
import sys

try:
    # Some operation
    pass
except:
    exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback = sys.exc_info()
    print(f"Exception type: {exc_type}")
    print(f"Exception value: {exc_value}")
```

### sys.exception() (Python 3.11+)

Returns just the exception instance:

```python
import sys

try:
    raise ValueError('test')
except ValueError:
    # These are equivalent:
    print(sys.exc_info()[1])        # Old way
    print(sys.exception())          # New way
```

### Comparison of Methods

```python
try:
    raise CustomError('info')
except CustomError as X:
    print((type(X), X))                          # Method 1: as clause
    print(sys.exc_info()[:2])                    # Method 2: sys.exc_info
    print((type(sys.exception()), sys.exception()))  # Method 3: sys.exception
```

## Error Display and Tracebacks

### Using the traceback Module

```python
import traceback

def inverse(x):
    return 1 / x

try:
    inverse(0)
except Exception:
    traceback.print_exc(file=open('error.txt', 'w'))
print('Program continues...')
```

**Generated error.txt:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "script.py", line 7, in <module>
    inverse(0)
  File "script.py", line 4, in inverse
    return 1 / x
           ~~^~~
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

## Exception Design Guidelines

### What Should Be Wrapped

#### ✅ Good Candidates for try/except
- **System interface operations** (file I/O, network calls)
- **User input validation**
- **External service calls**
- **Resource allocation**

#### ❌ Avoid Wrapping
- **Simple internal calculations** (unless failure is expected)
- **Operations where failure should terminate the program**

### Wrapping Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Single function wrap** | Function contains multiple risky operations | `try: risky_function()` |
| **Individual operation wrap** | Need granular error handling | `try: file.read()` |
| **Outer program wrap** | Development/debugging | `try: main_program()` |

## Common Exception Anti-Patterns

### 1. Catching Too Much

#### ❌ Empty except (Dangerous)
```python
def func():
    try:
        # Some operation
        pass
    except:
        pass  # Silently catches EVERYTHING, including SystemExit!
```

#### ❌ Catching Exception (Still Risky)
```python
try:
    x = myditctionary[key]  # Typo: should be mydictionary
except Exception:
    x = None  # Masks NameError, assumes only KeyError possible
```

#### ✅ Specific Exception Handling
```python
try:
    x = mydictionary[key]
except KeyError:
    x = None  # Only catches the expected error
```

### 2. Preventing System Exits

```python
import sys

def bye():
    sys.exit(62)           # Crucial error: abort now!

try:
    bye()
except:                    # Oops--this catches SystemExit too!
    print('Got it')        

print('Continuing...')     # Program doesn't exit as intended
```

#### ✅ Solution: Use Exception Base Class
```python
try:
    bye()
except Exception:          # Won't catch SystemExit, KeyboardInterrupt
    print('Got it')
```

### 3. Catching Too Little

#### ❌ Overly Specific
```python
try:
    # Some operation
    pass
except (MyExcept1, MyExcept2):    # Breaks if you add MyExcept3 later
    # Handle error
    pass
```

#### ✅ Class-Based Categories
```python
try:
    # Some operation  
    pass
except CommonCategoryName:        # OK if you add MyExcept3 subclass later
    # Handle error
    pass
```

## Best Practices Summary

### Exception Handling Guidelines

!!! tip "Golden Rules"
    1. **Be specific** - Catch only the exceptions you expect
    2. **Fail fast** - Don't hide programming errors
    3. **Clean up resources** - Use try/finally or context managers
    4. **Document behavior** - Make exception handling explicit

### Design Principles

1. **Prefer EAFP over LBYL**
   - "Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission"
   - Use try/except rather than checking conditions first

2. **Use exceptions for exceptional conditions**
   - Not for normal control flow
   - Signal genuine error conditions

3. **Create exception hierarchies**
   - Use inheritance for related exceptions
   - Enable flexible exception handling

4. **Provide useful error messages**
   - Include context and suggested solutions
   - Make debugging easier

## Knowledge Check

### Quiz Question
**Q: What's the significance of the mouse on this book's cover?**

**A:** The wood rat (Neotoma muridae) was chosen because it's common food for pythons. The metaphor suggests that the wood rat must learn about the python to avoid being eaten. Additionally, Neotoma are pack rats that collect shiny objects, which parallels Python's history of language-feature accumulation.

## Part VII Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Exception Handling
Write a function called `oops` that raises an `IndexError`. Then write another function that catches this error. Experiment with changing the exception type.

### Exercise 2: Custom Exceptions  
Modify `oops` to raise a custom `MyError` exception defined as a class. Catch both `MyError` and `IndexError` and print the caught instance.

### Exercise 3: Generic Error Handler
Write a `safe(func, *pargs, **kargs)` function that:
- Runs any function with arbitrary arguments
- Catches any exception
- Prints exception info using `sys.exc_info()`
- Optionally prints stack trace using `traceback.print_exc()`

### Exercise 4: Self-Study Examples
Explore the example scripts in Appendix B that demonstrate real-world exception handling patterns.
